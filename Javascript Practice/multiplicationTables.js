//Nested loop was able to print all 100 numbers for a multiplication table from 1 to 10, but having trouble figuring out how to display as a grid.

for(i=1; i<11; i++) 
    for(j=1; j<11; j++)
    console.log(i*j)

//To do this, we need to create a table variable and make it be an empty array. Also create row and column arrays.

let table = [];
for(i=1; i<11; i++) 
    for(j=1; j<11; j++)
    console.log(i*j)
